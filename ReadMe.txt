This assignment aims to help you practice the heap data structure and heap sort algorithm. 
Your main task in this assignment is to develop a simple leaderboard system using C programming language.


Overview:
Every leaderboard needs a couple of sorting features to help you see which participant is the leader when it comes to a certain aspect. 
Having the most wins does not mean the best win rate, and the expectation to win placed upon each opponent plays a major role, especially in the betting department. 
Since heap sort has been the highlight of the week, the focus will mostly be on implementing it to sort our leaderboard the way the user desires.
