This assignment aims to help you practice graph data structure and basic graph operations. 
Your main task in this assignment is to develop a simple scanpath analyser using C programming language.


Overview:
Eye tracking is commonly used to understand how people interact with visual stimuli. When people interact with visual stimuli, 
their eyes become relatively stable at certain points which are referred to as fixations, and the series of these fixations represent their scanpaths. 
Eye-tracking data analysis is usually conducted based on the areas of interest (AOIs) of visual stimuli, specifically which AOIs are commonly used and in which order. 
Figure 1 shows an example of a scanpath of a particular user on one web page of Wordpress.com where the red rectangles show the AOIs of the web page, 
and the yellow circles show the userâ€™s fixations - the radius of each circle is directly proportional to the duration of its corresponding fixation.
